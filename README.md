I've completed a task using MERN technology, but instead of MongoDB, I opted to use a CSV file. I'm currently considering switching to Django to further explore and enhance my skills. I have about 5 months of experience with JavaScript, and I'm eager to broaden my expertise with other technologies.

 ● order_date: date when the order was placed
 ● product_id: unique identifier for each product
 ● product_name: name of the product
 ● product_price: price of the product
 ● quantity: quantity of the product ordered
 Your task is to write a Python program that reads the data from the CSV file and performs
 the following tasks:
 ● Computethe total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the dataset.
 ● Computethe total revenue generated by each product in the dataset.
 ● Computethe total revenue generated by each customer in the
 dataset.
 ● Identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated.
 Instructions
 ● Write a Python program that reads the data from the orders.csv file and performs the
 tasks outlined above. If you are not familiar with Python, feel free to use any
 language you are familiar with. Please be informed that we use Python, Golang and
 JS at tanX. So you’ll be asked to pick up these languages for your day-to-day tasks if
 you were to join tanX.
 ● Write tests for your code.
 ● Commityour changes to your branch.
 ● Dockerize your application. Create two separate services:- one for the task, and one
 for the test. Include instructions on how to run the tests and the task in the README
 of your repo
